## Scrum

### What is Scrum?

Agile scrum methodology is a **sprint-based** project management system with the goal of delivering the **highest value** to **stakeholders**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Daily Stand-Up?

The daily stand-up is an **everyday meeting** (most preferably held in the morning) in which the whole team meets for almost **15 minutes** to find answer to the following three questions:

- What was **done yesterday**?
- What is your **plan for today**?
- Is there any impediment or block that **restricts** you from completing your task?

The daily stand-up is an effective way to motivate the team and make them set a goal for the day.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Scrum ban?

Scrum-ban is a **Scrum** and **Kanban**-based model for the **software development**. This model is specifically used for the projects that need **continuous maintenance**, have various programming errors or have some sudden changes. This model promotes the completion of a project in **minimum time** for a programming error or user story.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the use of Burn-up and Burn-down charts?

The burn-up chart illustrates the amount of **completed work** in a project whereas the burn-down chart depicts the amount of work **remained** to complete a project. Thus, the burn-up and burn-down charts are used to trace the **progress** of a project.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Story Point in Scrum?

A story point in Scrum is the **unit for the estimation** of total **efforts** that are required to perform or complete a particular **task**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Web

### What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed **version control** system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol for **fetching resources** such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a **client-server protocol**, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is DNS?
 
The Domain Name System (DNS) turns **domain names** into **IP addresses**, which browsers use to load internet pages.

Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.

DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers, such as github.com, without having to keep track of the IP address for every website.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is JWT?

JSON Web Tokens are an **open**, **industry standard method** for representing claims **securely** between **two parties**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is CORS?

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows **restricted** resources on a web page to be requested from another domain **outside** the domain from which the first resource was served.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is SSL?

SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an **encryption**-based Internet **security protocol** with the purpose of ensuring **privacy**, **authentication**, and **data integrity** in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern **TLS** encryption used today.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is FTP?

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard **communication protocol** used for the **transfer** of **computer files** from a **server** to a **client** on a computer network.

FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is REST?

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between decoupled components in the Internet in a **Client-Server architecture**.

REST defines four interface constraints:

- Identification of resources
- Manipulation of resources
- Self-descriptive messages and
- hypermedia as the engine of application state

Generally it describes a machine to machine interface and more specifically in web development it allows for an addition or replacement of server-side rendering to assist client-side rendering in web applications as client server model where the web browser acts as the client.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the differences between Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookie?

#### **Local Storage**

localStorage is a way to **store data** on the client’s computer. It allows the saving of **key/value pairs** in a web browser and it stores data with no **expiration date**.

localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data.

Pros:
- stores data with no expiration date
- storage limit is about 5MB
- data is never transferred to the server

Cons:
- plaintext, hence not secure by design
- limited to string data, hence need to be serialized
- can only be read on client-side

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Session storage**

Same as localstorage , we can write key-value pair in session storage as well.

- stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed
- data is never transferred to the server
- can only be read on client-side
- storage limit is about 5-10MB
- opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Cookie**

Cookies can be updated , set using document.cookie object from browser window object.

- Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .
- Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.
- Size must be less than 4KB.
- Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie.

## Design Principles

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. 

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the 5 SOLID principles?

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Single-Responsiblity Principle**

```quote
A class should have one and only one reason to change.
```

Meaning that a class should have only one job.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Open-Closed Principle**

Intially written about by Bertrand Meyer in the 1980s, Uncle Bob calls this the "most important principle of object-oriented design".

Generally, this principle is all about writing your code in such a way so that when you need to add new functionality, it shouldn't require changing the existing code.

To do this, we write **interfaces** and **abstract classes** in order to dictate the higher-level policy that needs to be implemented, and then we implement that policy using concrete classes.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Liskov-Substitution Principle**

The Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data abstraction” in 1987.

The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.

In Uncle Bob's "Clean Architecture", he says:
```quote
"To build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be substituted one for another."
```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Interface Segregation Principle**

```quote
Prevent classes from relying on things that they dont need
```

In order to prevent this, it is needed to really split up the unique functionality into interfaces.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle**

```quote
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
```

What's an abstraction again? An interface or abstract class.

What's a detail again? A concrete class.

Abstractions should never depend on details. Ok, so that means, try not to do this:

```typescript
interface IMailService {
  // refering to concrete "PrettyEmail" and "ShortEmailTransmissionResult" from an abstraction
  sendMail(email: PrettyEmail): Promise<ShortEmailTransmissionResult>
}
```

But instead, do this:
```typescript
class SendGridEmailService implements IMailService {
  // concrete class relies on abstractions
  sendMail(email: IMail): Promise<IEmailTransmissionResult> {
  }
}
```

## HTML

### What is the \<meta\> element?

The <meta> HTML element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the use of \<header\>?

The \<header\> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the use of \<article\>?

The \<article\> HTML element represents a **self-contained** composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).

Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the use of \<section\>?

The \<section\> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the use of \<footer\>?

The \<footer\> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. 

A \<footer\> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between \<div\> and \<span\>?

- div is a block element
- span is an inline element.

This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the alt attribute? What is it used for?

The required alt attribute specifies an **alternate text** for an **image**, if the image **cannot be displayed**.

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## CSS

### What is box model?

When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are CSS selectors?

CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Mixin?

Mixins allow document authors to define patterns of property value pairs, which can then be reused in other rulesets. The mixin name is a class selector that identifies the mixin being declared. The @mixin keyword must be followed by the mixin name and a declaration block.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Preprocessor?

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between Grid and Flexbox?

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications share some common features, however, and if you have already learned how to use flexbox, the similarities should help you get to grips with Grid.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Javascript

### What are Block Statements?

Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements i.e. while, for, if etc. The block is delimited by a pair of **curly brackets**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the Typeof operator?

The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Promises?

Promises are a way of dealing with **asynchronous** code.

for sake of example, we're just using setTimeout. This could be any asynchronous action as well:
```javascript
function asyncA(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 100) }
function asyncB(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 200) }
function asyncC(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 300) }
 
asyncA(function(resultA) {
  asyncB(function(resultB) {
    asyncC(function(resultC) {
      someFunction(resultA, resultB, resultC)
    })
  })
})
```
Code using promises can make asynchronous code easier to compose, and can also avoid the common issue of **“callback hell”**:

```javascript
function promiseA() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100)) }
function promiseB() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 200)) }
function promiseC() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)) }
 
Promise.all([promiseA(), promiseB(), promiseC()]).then(([a, b, c]) => {
  someFunction(a, b, c)
})
```

### What are Arrow Functions? What are their advantages?

Arrows is a new syntax for functions, which brings several benefits:

- Arrow syntax automatically binds this to the surrounding code’s context
- The syntax allows an implicit return when there is no body block, resulting in shorter and simpler code in some cases
- Last but not least, => is shorter and simpler than function, although stylistic issues are often subjective

**Implicit Return:**

**ES5** style:

```javascript
el.onclick = function(x, y, z) {
  return this.doSomething()
}.bind(this)
```

**ES6** style:
```javascript
el.onclick = (x, y, z) => this.doSomething()
```

**Map**

**ES5** style:
```javascript
var names = users.map(function(u) { return u.name })
 ```

**ES6** style:
```javascript
var names = users.map(u => u.name)
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Hoisting in JS?

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving all declarations to the **top of the current scope** (to the top of the current script or the current function).

Variables defined with **let** and **const** are hoisted to the top of the block, but **not initialized**.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a **let** variable before it is declared will result in a **ReferenceError**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the usage of the Array method find?

The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

```javascript
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44]

const found = array1.find(element => element > 10)

console.log(found)
// expected output: 12
```

- If you need the index of the found element in the array, use findIndex().
- If you need to find the index of a value, use Array.prototype.indexOf(). (It's similar to findIndex(), but checks each element for equality with the value instead of using a testing function.)
- If you need to find if a value exists in an array, use Array.prototype.includes(). Again, it checks each element for equality with the value instead of using a testing function.
- If you need to find if any element satisfies the provided testing function, use Array.prototype.some().

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the usage of the Array method map?

The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16]

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2)

console.log(map1)
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the usage of the Array method filter?

The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const array = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

const isPrime = (num) => {
  for (let i = 2; num > i; i++) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return num > 1
}

console.log(array.filter(isPrime)) // [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Closure?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state. A closure gives you access to an **outer function’s scope** from an **inner function**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Higher Order Function?

A higher order function is a function that takes a **function as an argument**, or **returns a function**

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference in usage between const and Object.freeze?

const applies to bindings ("variables"). It creates an immutable binding, i.e. you cannot assign a new value to the binding.

Object.freeze works on values, and more specifically, object values. It makes an object immutable, i.e. you cannot change its properties.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Webworkers?

Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.

Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Testing

### What is a Unit Test?

A unit test is a way of testing a unit: the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a Integration Test?

Integration Testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers.

The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a end-to-end test?

End-to-end testing, also known as E2E testing, is a methodology used for ensuring that applications behave as expected and that the flow of data is maintained for all kinds of user tasks and processes.

This type of testing approach starts from the end user’s perspective and simulates a real-world scenario.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Angular

### What is Angular?

Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Typescript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language created by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript.
It adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. 
Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Single Page Applications?

Single-page applications are web applications that load once with new features just being mere additions to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the new page's content, instead generated dynamically.

This is made possible through JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM elements on the existing page itself. A SPA approach is faster, thus providing a seamless user experience.

### What are Directives?

Directives add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance.

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular/core'

@Directive({ selector: '[myHighlight]' })
export class HighlightDirective {
    constructor(el: ElementRef) {
       el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow'
    }
}
```

Now this directive extends HTML element behavior with a yellow background as below:
```html
<p myHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
```

Now this directive extends HTML element behavior with a yellow background as below

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Components?

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app which formed a tree of Angular components. These components are subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template. 

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Services in Angular?

Angular Services perform tasks that are used by multiple components. These tasks could be data and image fetching, network connections, and database management among others.

They perform all the operational tasks for the components and avoid rewriting of code. A service can be written once and injected into all the components that use that service.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the differences between Component and Directive?

In a short note, A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.

### What are Decorators?

Decorators are a design pattern or functions that define how Angular features work. They are used to make prior modifications to a class, service, or filter. Angular supports four types of decorators, they are:

- Class Decorators
- Property Decorators
- Method Decorators
- Parameter Decorators

### What is a Template?

A template is a **HTML** view where you can display data by binding controls to properties of an Angular component. You can store your component's template in one of **two places**. You can define it **inline** using the template property, or you can define the template in a **separate HTML file** and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property.

### What is a Module?

Angular applications are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules. NgModules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. 

They can contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule. They can import functionality that is exported from other NgModules, and export selected functionality for use by other NgModules.

Every Angular application has at least one NgModule class, the root module, which is conventionally named AppModule and resides in a file named *app.module.ts*.

### What are Lifecycle Hooks?

A component instance has a lifecycle that starts when Angular instantiates the component class and renders the component view along with its child views.

The lifecycle continues with change detection, as Angular checks to see when data-bound properties change, and updates both the view and the component instance as needed. The lifecycle ends when Angular destroys the component instance and removes its rendered template from the DOM.

Directives have a similar lifecycle, as Angular creates, updates, and destroys instances in the course of execution.

The description of each lifecycle method is as below:

- ngOnChanges: When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.
- ngOnInit: This is called whenever the initialization of the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.
- ngDoCheck: This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
- ngAfterContentInit: This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
- ngAfterContentChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
- ngAfterViewInit: This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
- ngAfterViewChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
- ngOnDestroy: This is the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive/component.

### What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special method which will be called whenever we create new objects. And generally used of initializing the class members. It is a feature of the class(typescript) itself, an object-oriented design concept not Angular.

A constructor example in Angular:
```typescript
class Square
{
    constructor(private height: number, private width: number){}

    calculateArea = () => this.height * this.width
}
```
In the example from above, the constructor will be automatically invoked by JavaScript engine when we create a new object.

### What is ngOnInit() in Angular?

- ngOnInit is a life cycle hook managed by Angular
- ngOnInit being added to prototype of the class created
- ngOnInit called by Angular when component is initialized
- Actual business logic performed ngOnInit method

Every component we create has a life cycle managed by Angular.

As part of the life cycle, angular creates it, renders it and checks when its bounded data properties changes, destroys the component before removing it from the DOM.

### When is ngOnInit() Executed?

- ngOnInit will be executed, When Angular done with the creating of component DOM.
- ngOnInit will be called after the constructor execution and after first ngOnChanges

### What is a Data Binding?

Data binding is a core concept in Angular and allows to define **communication between a component and the DOM**, making it very easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data. 

There are **four** forms of data binding(divided as 3 categories) which differ in the way the data is flowing.

- From the Component to the DOM:

**Interpolation**: {{ value }}: Adds the value of a property from the component

```html
<li>Name: {{ user.name }}</li>
<li>Address: {{ user.address }}</li>
```

**Property binding**: [property]=”value”: The value is passed from the component to the specified property or simple HTML attribute

```html
<input type="email" [value]="user.email">
```

- **From the DOM to the Component**: Event binding: (event)=”function”: When a specific DOM event happens (eg.: click, change, keyup), call the specified method in the component

```html
<button (click)="logout()"></button>
```

- **Two-way binding**: Two-way data binding: [(ngModel)]=”value”: Two-way data binding allows to have the data flow both ways. For example, in the below code snippet, both the email DOM input and component email property are in sync

```html
<input type="email" [(ngModel)]="user.email">
```

### What are Pipes?

Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once.

```html
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>
```

### What is the difference between AOT and JIT? 

Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation converts your code during the build time before the browser downloads and runs that code. This ensures faster rendering to the browser. To specify AOT compilation, include the --aot option with the ng build or ng serve command. 

The Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation process is a way of compiling computer code to machine code during execution or run time. It is also known as dynamic compilation. JIT compilation is the default when you run the ng build or ng serve CLI commands.

### What are AOT advantages?

- Faster rendering
- Fewer asynchronous requests
- Smaller Angular framework download size
- Quick detection of template errors
- Better security

### What are the differences between Reactive Forms vs Template Forms?

Template-driven approach:

- In this method, the conventional form tag is used to create forms. Angular automatically interprets and creates a form object representation for the tag. 
- Controls can be added to the form using the NGModel tag. Multiple controls can be grouped using the NGControlGroup module. 
- A form value can be generated using the “form.value” object. Form data is exported as JSON values when the submit method is called. 
- Basic HTML validations can be used to validate the form fields. In the case of custom validations, directives can be used. 
- Arguably, this method is the simplest way to create an Angular App. 

Reactive Form Approach:

- This approach is the programming paradigm oriented around data flows and propagation of change. 
- With Reactive forms, the component directly manages the data flows between the form controls and the data models. 
- Reactive forms are code-driven, unlike the template-driven approach. 
- Reactive forms break from the traditional declarative approach. 
- Reactive forms eliminate the anti-pattern of updating the data model via two-way data binding.
- Typically, Reactive form control creation is synchronous and can be unit tested with synchronous programming techniques.

### What is Eager and Lazy loading?

Eager loading is the default module-loading strategy. Feature modules under Eager loading are loaded before the application starts. This is typically used for small size applications.

Lazy loading dynamically loads the feature modules when there's a demand. This makes the application faster. It is used for bigger applications where all the modules are not required at the start of the application. 

### What is Sanitization? Does angular supports it?

Sanitization is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. Yes, Angular suppports sanitization. It sanitizes untrusted values for HTML, styles, and URLs but sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code.
