## Scrum

### What is Scrum?

Agile scrum methodology is a **sprint-based** project management system with the goal of delivering the **highest value** to **stakeholders**.

### What is Daily Stand-Up?

The daily stand-up is an **everyday meeting** (most preferably held in the morning) in which the whole team meets for almost **15 minutes** to find answer to the following three questions:

- What was **done yesterday**?
- What is your **plan for today**?
- Is there any impediment or block that **restricts** you from completing your task?

The daily stand-up is an effective way to motivate the team and make them set a goal for the day.

### What is Scrum ban?

Scrum-ban is a **Scrum** and **Kanban**-based model for the **software development**. This model is specifically used for the projects that need **continuous maintenance**, have various programming errors or have some sudden changes. This model promotes the completion of a project in **minimum time** for a programming error or user story.

### What is the use of burn-up and burn-down charts?

The burn-up chart illustrates the amount of **completed work** in a project whereas the burn-down chart depicts the amount of work **remained** to complete a project. Thus, the burn-up and burn-down charts are used to trace the **progress** of a project.

### What is a story point in Scrum?

A story point in Scrum is the **unit for the estimation** of total **efforts** that are required to perform or complete a particular **task**.

## Web

### What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed **version control** system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol for **fetching resources** such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a **client-server protocol**, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

### What is DNS?
 
The Domain Name System (DNS) turns **domain names** into **IP addresses**, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers, such as github.com, without having to keep track of the IP address for every website.
### What is JWT?

JSON Web Tokens are an **open**, **industry standard method** for representing claims **securely** between **two parties**.

### What is CORS?

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows **restricted** resources on a web page to be requested from another domain **outside** the domain from which the first resource was served.

### What is SSL?

SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an **encryption**-based Internet **security protocol** with the purpose of ensuring **privacy**, **authentication**, and **data integrity** in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern **TLS** encryption used today.

### What is FTP?

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard **communication protocol** used for the **transfer** of **computer files** from a **server** to a **client** on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

### What is REST?

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between decoupled components in the Internet in a **Client-Server architecture**. REST defines four interface constraints:

- Identification of resources
- Manipulation of resources
- Self-descriptive messages and
- hypermedia as the engine of application state

Generally it describes a machine to machine interface and more specifically in web development it allows for an addition or replacement of server-side rendering to assist client-side rendering in web applications as client server model where the web browser acts as the client.

### What are the differences between Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookie?

#### **Local Storage**

localStorage is a way to **store data** on the client’s computer. It allows the saving of **key/value pairs** in a web browser and it stores data with no **expiration date**. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data.

Pros:
- stores data with no expiration date
- storage limit is about 5MB
- data is never transferred to the server

Cons:
- plaintext, hence not secure by design
- limited to string data, hence need to be serialized
- can only be read on client-side

#### **Session storage**

Same as localstorage , we can write key-value pair in session storage as well.

- stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed
- data is never transferred to the server
- can only be read on client-side
- storage limit is about 5-10MB
- opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window

#### **Cookie**

Cookies can be updated , set using document.cookie object from browser window object.

- Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .
- Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.
- Size must be less than 4KB.
- Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie.

## Design Principles

### What is dependency injection?

Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. 

### What are the 5 SOLID principles?

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

#### **Single-responsiblity Principle**

```quote
A class should have one and only one reason to change.
```

Meaning that a class should have only one job.

#### **Open-closed Principle**

Intially written about by Bertrand Meyer in the 1980s, Uncle Bob calls this the "most important principle of object-oriented design".

Generally, this principle is all about writing your code in such a way so that when you need to add new functionality, it shouldn't require changing the existing code.

To do this, we write **interfaces** and **abstract classes** in order to dictate the higher-level policy that needs to be implemented, and then we implement that policy using concrete classes.

#### **Liskov-Substitution Principle**

The Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data abstraction” in 1987.

The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.

In Uncle Bob's "Clean Architecture", he says:
```quote
"To build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be substituted one for another."
```

#### **Interface Segregation Principle**

```quote
Prevent classes from relying on things that they dont need
```

In order to prevent this, it is needed to really split up the unique functionality into interfaces.

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle**

```quote
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
```

What's an abstraction again? An interface or abstract class.

What's a detail again? A concrete class.

Abstractions should never depend on details. Ok, so that means, try not to do this:

```Typescript
interface IMailService {
  // refering to concrete "PrettyEmail" and "ShortEmailTransmissionResult" from an abstraction
  sendMail(email: PrettyEmail): Promise<ShortEmailTransmissionResult>
}
```

But instead, do this:
```Typescript
class SendGridEmailService implements IMailService {
  // concrete class relies on abstractions
  sendMail(email: IMail): Promise<IEmailTransmissionResult> {
  }
}
```

## HTML

### What is the \<meta\> element?

The <meta> HTML element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.

### What is the use of \<header\>?

The \<header\> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

### What is the use of \<article\>?

The \<article\> HTML element represents a **self-contained** composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).

Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

### What is the use of \<section\>?

The \<section\> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

### What is the use of \<footer\>?

The \<footer\> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. 

A \<footer\> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents

### What is the difference between \<div\> and \<span\>?

- div is a block element
- span is an inline element.

This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.

### What is the alt attribute? What is it used for?

The required alt attribute specifies an **alternate text** for an **image**, if the image **cannot be displayed**.

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

### What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

## CSS

### What is box model?

When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

### What are CSS selectors?

CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.

### What is a mixin?

Mixins allow document authors to define patterns of property value pairs, which can then be reused in other rulesets. The mixin name is a class selector that identifies the mixin being declared. The @mixin keyword must be followed by the mixin name and a declaration block.

### What is a preprocessor?

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.

### What is the difference between grid and flexbox?

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications share some common features, however, and if you have already learned how to use flexbox, the similarities should help you get to grips with Grid.

## Javascript

###  What are block statements?

Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements i.e. while, for, if etc. The block is delimited by a pair of **curly brackets**.

### What is the typeof operator?

The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

###  What are promises?

Promises are a way of dealing with **asynchronous** code.

for sake of example, we're just using setTimeout. This could be any asynchronous action as well:
```js
function asyncA(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 100); }
function asyncB(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 200); }
function asyncC(callback) { setTimeout(callback, 300); }
 
asyncA(function(resultA) {
  asyncB(function(resultB) {
    asyncC(function(resultC) {
      someFunction(resultA, resultB, resultC);
    });
  });
});
```
Code using promises can make asynchronous code easier to compose, and can also avoid the common issue of **“callback hell”**:

```js
function promiseA() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); }
function promiseB() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 200)); }
function promiseC() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); }
 
Promise.all([promiseA(), promiseB(), promiseC()]).then(([a, b, c]) => {
  someFunction(a, b, c);
});
```

###  What are arrow functions? What are their advantages?

Arrows is a new syntax for functions, which brings several benefits:

- Arrow syntax automatically binds this to the surrounding code’s context
- The syntax allows an implicit return when there is no body block, resulting in shorter and simpler code in some cases
- Last but not least, => is shorter and simpler than function, although stylistic issues are often subjective

**Implicit Return:**

**ES5** style:

```js
el.onclick = function(x, y, z) {
  return this.doSomething()
}.bind(this)
```

**ES6** style:
```js
el.onclick = (x, y, z) => this.doSomething()
```

**Map**

**ES5** style:
```js
var names = users.map(function(u) { return u.name })
 ```

**ES6** style:
```js
var names = users.map(u => u.name)
```

###  What is hoisting in JS?

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving all declarations to the **top of the current scope** (to the top of the current script or the current function).

Variables defined with **let** and **const** are hoisted to the top of the block, but **not initialized**.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a **let** variable before it is declared will result in a **ReferenceError**.

### What is a closure?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state. A closure gives you access to an **outer function’s scope** from an **inner function**.

### What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that takes a **function as an argument**, or **returns a function**

### What is the difference in usage between const and Object.freeze?

const applies to bindings ("variables"). It creates an immutable binding, i.e. you cannot assign a new value to the binding.

Object.freeze works on values, and more specifically, object values. It makes an object immutable, i.e. you cannot change its properties.

### What are webworkers?

Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.

Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).

## Testing

### What is a unit test?

A unit test is a way of testing a unit: the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system.

### What is a integration test?

Integration Testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated

### What is a end-to-end test?

End-to-end testing, also known as E2E testing, is a methodology used for ensuring that applications behave as expected and that the flow of data is maintained for all kinds of user tasks and processes. This type of testing approach starts from the end user’s perspective and simulates a real-world scenario.

## Angular

### What is interpolation?

Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ and }} as delimiters.

```html
<h3>Current customer: {{ currentCustomer }}</h3>
```

### What are pipes?

Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once.

```html
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>
```

### What is Angular TestBed?

Configures and initializes environment for unit testing and provides methods for creating components and services in unit tests.

### What is RxJS?

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

### What are the differences between Reactive Forms vs Template Forms?

Template Driven Forms:

- Easy to use
- Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
- Similar to AngularJS
- Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
- Minimal component code
- Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)

Reactive Forms Features:

- More flexible, but needs a more practice
- More flexible, making it handle more complex scenarios
- No data binding is done (immutable data model preferred by most developers)
- Handling a event based on a debounce time
- Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
- Adding input elements dynamically
- Easier unit testing
