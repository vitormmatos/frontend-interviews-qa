## What is box model?

When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

## What is a Mixin?

Mixins allow document authors to define patterns of property value pairs, which can then be reused in other rulesets. The mixin name is a class selector that identifies the mixin being declared. The @mixin keyword must be followed by the mixin name and a declaration block.

## What is the difference between Grid and Flexbox?

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications share some common features, however, and if you have already learned how to use flexbox, the similarities should help you get to grips with Grid.
