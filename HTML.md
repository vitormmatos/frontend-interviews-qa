## What is the use of **\<article\>**?

The \<article\> HTML element represents a **self-contained** composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).

Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

## What is the use of **\<section\>**?

The \<section\> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

## What is the use of **\<footer\>**?

The \<footer\> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element.

A \<footer\> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents

## What is the difference between **\<div\>** and **\<span\>**?

- div is a block element
- span is an inline element.

This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.

## What is the **alt** attribute? What is it used for?

The required alt attribute specifies an **alternate text** for an **image**, if the image **cannot be displayed**.

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

## What is the **DOM**?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
